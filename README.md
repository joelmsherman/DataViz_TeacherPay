# Makeover Monday (MoM) - Week 37
**Teacher Pay in the UK**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## Source Article and Viz
This week's Viz: Week 37 brings [a viz](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w37-school-workforce-in-england) showing mean teacher pay among men and women teachers for a variety of teaching positions in the state-funded school system.

## Data Source
Data comes from UK.gov's School Workforce Census [here](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/school-workforce-in-england#releaseHeadlines-charts).

## My Approach for Week 37
The original viz is a colored bar plot that is confusing and hard to read, but generally shows gender gaps in pay.  In my recreation, I chose to focus, front and center, on the gaps in pay between men and woman, and allow the user to look at the gap from both a percentage and raw (british pound) basis.
